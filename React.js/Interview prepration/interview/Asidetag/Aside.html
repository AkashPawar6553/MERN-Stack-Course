        <h2>About React</h2>
        <p>
            React is a JavaScript library, developed by Meta (formerly Facebook), used for building user interfaces,
            especially for web applications, known for its component-based architecture and efficient rendering.
        </p>
        <p>
            <p>* What it is:
                React is a JavaScript library, not a framework, focusing on building user interfaces by creating reusable,
                self-contained components.
            </p>
            <p>
                * Component-Based:
            React applications are built using components, which are essentially JavaScript functions that return
            HTML-like structures (JSX).
            </p>
            <p>
                * JSX:
            React uses JSX, a syntax extension to JavaScript, that allows you to write HTML-like code within your
            JavaScript code, making it easier to define UI elements.
            </p>
            <p>
                * Virtual DOM:
            React uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to efficiently update the user interface. Instead of
            directly manipulating the browser's DOM, React creates a virtual representation, making changes, and then
            updates the actual DOM only when necessary, leading to faster performance.
            </p>
            <p>
                * One-way Data Binding:
            React uses one-way data binding, meaning data flows from parent to child components. Child components can't
            directly modify parent component data, promoting a predictable and manageable data flow.
            Reusability:
